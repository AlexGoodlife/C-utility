# Generic data structures and algorithms

This library serves as a useful addition to any C program that might need a certain data structure or algorithm without the need to write it yourself.  
These functions and structs were made as an educational exercise but they can serve a purpose as a simple and lightweight library.

This library was made in Windows with it in consideration so performance on other OS systems is unknown

## Tools

 - [ ] Generic Hash table struct 
 - [ ] Generic Stack struct 
 - [ ] Generic Queue struct
 - [ ] Several generic algorithms like merge sort and binary search

## Installation and compilation
   To install, download the include folder and the lib folder and paste them in your C library path.  

   To compile you just have to link the libraries to your program, as an example compilation statement using gcc:  
   >gcc your_program.c -IC:\YourIncludePath -LC:\YourLibraryPath -lcutility -o executable_name

   Alternatively you can copy the source and header files and compile them with your program

## Todo
   - [ ] Trees and heaps
   - [ ] More generic algorithms


## Example usage
